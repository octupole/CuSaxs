## About CuSAXS

CuSAXS is a computational tool designed for structural biology and materials science researchers who need to calculate SAXS intensity profiles from molecular dynamics simulations. The software leverages GPU acceleration to significantly speed up SAXS calculations while maintaining high accuracy through advanced B-spline interpolation methods.

## Scientific Background

Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) is a powerful experimental technique used to study the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules and materials in solution. CuSAXS bridges the gap between molecular dynamics simulations and experimental SAXS data by providing accurate theoretical predictions.

### Implementation Details

CuSAXS implements state-of-the-art algorithms for SAXS calculation:

1. **Density Interpolation**: Uses high-order B-spline interpolation to map atomic positions onto regular grids
2. **Form Factor Calculation**: Applies atomic form factors with proper q-dependence  
3. **Fourier Transform**: Employs cuFFT for efficient 3D FFT calculations
4. **Scattering Averaging**: Performs proper orientational and ensemble averaging

## Installation

### System Requirements

#### Hardware
- NVIDIA GPU with compute capability 7.5 or higher (GTX 1650 Ti, RTX 20xx series or newer)
- At least 4GB GPU memory (8GB+ recommended for large systems)

#### Software
- **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+ recommended)
- **CUDA Toolkit**: 11.0 or later
- **CMake**: 3.16 or later
- **Python**: 3.8 or later
- **Qt6**: For optional GUI interface
- **Compiler**: GCC 9.0+ or Clang 10.0+

### Installation Steps

#### 1. Install System Dependencies

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cmake build-essential python3-dev python3-pybind11-dev libomp-dev
# For optional GUI support
sudo apt install qt6-base-dev qt6-tools-dev qt6-tools-dev-tools
```

#### 2. Install CUDA Toolkit

Follow the [official NVIDIA CUDA installation guide](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) for your system.

#### 3. Clone and Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CuSAXS.git
cd CuSAXS
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure with CMake
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# Optional: disable GUI if Qt6 is not available
# cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_GUI=OFF

# Build
make -j$(nproc)
```

#### 4. Conda Environment (Recommended)

For easier dependency management:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate cusaxs
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j$(nproc)
```

## Architecture

CuSAXS is built with a modular architecture:

- **Core Engine** (`CuSAXS.cu`): Main CUDA kernels and calculation routines
- **Execution Layer** (`Exec/`): Command-line interface and parameter handling
- **SAXS Algorithms** (`Saxs/`): B-spline interpolation and scattering calculations
- **System Interface** (`System/`): Trajectory reading and atom management
- **Utilities** (`Utilities/`): Mathematical functions and error handling
- **GUI** (`gui/`): Optional Qt6-based graphical interface
- **Python Integration** (`pysrc/`): Analysis and post-processing scripts

## Performance Characteristics

### GPU Memory Usage

CuSAXS efficiently manages GPU memory through:
- Dynamic memory allocation based on grid size
- Streaming calculations for large trajectories
- Optimized data structures for CUDA kernels

### Scaling Performance

Performance scales with:
- **Grid size**: O(NÂ³ log N) due to 3D FFT
- **Number of atoms**: Linear scaling with proper optimization
- **Trajectory length**: Linear scaling with frame processing
