# CUDA Optimizations Implemented

  ## Completed Optimizations:
  1. Unified Memory (cudaMallocManaged) - saxsKernel.cu:470-520
  2. Memory pools for frequent allocation/deallocation - saxsKernel.cu:550-650
  3. CUDA streams for CPU-GPU overlap - saxsKernel.cu:695-735
  4. NVIDIA Nsight profiling markers - Throughout saxsKernel.cu

  ## Performance Impact:
  - Expected 4-10x performance improvement
  - Reduced memory allocation overhead
  - Better GPU utilization through concurrent execution
  - Professional profiling support

  ## Usage:
  - Profiling: Run with nsys to see detailed performance analysis
  - Memory: Automatically manages CPU-GPU data transfers
  - Streams: Overlaps computation and memory transfers
